### Task: Build a Responsive Landing Page

#### **Objective:**
Create a responsive landing page based on the provided design preview. The page should adapt to different screen sizes, especially for screens with widths below 400px, and include a hamburger menu for the navbar.

#### **Preview Link:**
You can view the design preview here: [Landing Page Design Preview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xaFfww8O1kuzU9KboX04nq-KF2hHbkau/view?usp=sharing).

#### **Requirements:**
1. **Responsive Design:**
   - The page must be fully responsive.
   - Once the screen width drops below 400px, the layout should adjust accordingly to fit smaller screens.

2. **Mobile View (Below 400px):**
   - The page should automatically switch to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is below 400px.
   - Ensure that all elements remain visible and accessible on small screens.

3. **Navbar Transformation:**
   - On screens narrower than 400px, the navbar should change to a hamburger menu.

4. **Icon Usage:**
   -  You can download the icons or Use icons from Font Awesome using the following CDN link:
     ```html
     <link
       rel="stylesheet"
       href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.6.0/css/all.min.css"
       integrity="sha512-Kc323vGBEqzTmouAECnVceyQqyqdsSiqLQISBL29aUW4U/M7pSPA/gEUZQqv1cwx4OnYxTxve5UMg5GT6L4JJg=="
