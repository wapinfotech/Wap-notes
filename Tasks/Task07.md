### Task 1: Basic `for` Loop
Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10. Modify the loop to print only the even numbers between 1 and 10 by using a conditional statement inside the loop.
- **Hint:** Use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is even.

### Task 2: Iterating Over an Object with `for/in` Loop
Create an object named `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Use a `for/in` loop to iterate over the properties of the `car` object and print both the property names and their values.
- **Example Output:**
  ```
  make: Toyota
  model: Corolla
  year: 2020
  ```

### Task 3: Iterating Over an Array with `for/of` Loop
Create an array named `colors` with values like `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"`. Use a `for/of` loop to iterate over the array and print each color in uppercase.
- **Hint:** Use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert each color to uppercase.
- If we have a let name = "John", we can do name.toUpperCase()
- **Example Output:**
  ```
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
  ```

### Task 4: Counting Down with `while` Loop
Write a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1. Print each number as the loop iterates. After the loop ends, print "Liftoff!".
- **Hint:** Start with a variable initialized to 10, and decrement it inside the loop until it reaches 1.

### Task 5: Counting Down with Conditions

Write a `do/while` loop that counts down from 10 to 0. Inside the loop, use an `if-else` statement to check the value of the counter:
- If the counter is greater than 5, print "Counting down: [counter]".
- If the counter is equal to 5, print "Halfway there!".
- If the counter is less than 5 but greater than 0, print "Almost done: [counter]".
- When the counter reaches 0, print "Countdown complete!".

### Example Output:
```
Counting down: 10
Counting down: 9
Counting down: 8
Counting down: 7
Counting down: 6
Halfway there!
Almost done: 4
Almost done: 3
Almost done: 2
Almost done: 1
Countdown complete!
```
