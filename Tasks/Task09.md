## Arrays and array methods in JavaScript:

1. **Create an array of five numbers. Write a program that adds a new number to the end of the array using the `push` method and then removes the first element using the `shift` method. Print the updated array after each operation.**

2. **Write a program that initializes an array with the names of three fruits. Use the `unshift` method to add a new fruit at the beginning of the array and the `pop` method to remove the last fruit. Print the resulting array after each operation.**

3. **Given an array of numbers, write a program to concatenate another array of numbers to it using the `concat` method. After that, use the `slice` method to extract a portion of the new array and print both the original and sliced arrays.**

4. **Write a program that creates an array of strings. Use the `splice` method to add two new strings at the second position of the array. Then, use `splice` again to remove the third element. Print the array after each operation.**

5. **Initialize an array with five different colors. Use the `slice` method to create a new array containing only the second and third colors. Print both the original array and the sliced array.**
