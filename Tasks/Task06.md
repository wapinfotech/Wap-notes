### Task 1: Checking Even or Odd
- **Objective:** Use comparison operators and conditional statements.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Declare a variable `number` and assign any integer value.
  2. Write a program to check whether the number is even or odd.
  3. Use an `if-else` statement to print "Even" if the number is even, and "Odd" if itâ€™s odd.

### Task 2: Grading System
- **Objective:** Implement multiple conditions using `if-else if-else`.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Declare a variable `marks` and assign a value between 0 and 100.
  2. Write a program that assigns grades based on the following criteria:
     - 90 and above: "A"
     - 75 to 89: "B"
     - 50 to 74: "C"
     - Below 50: "Fail"
  3. Use `if-else if-else` statements to print the grade.

### Task 3: Find the Largest Number
- **Objective:** Compare multiple variables and use conditional statements.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Declare three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with different integer values.
  2. Write a program to find and print the largest number among the three using comparison operators and `if-else` statements.

### Task 4: Admission Eligibility Checker
- **Objective:** Combine variable declaration, comparison operators, and conditional logic.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Declare a variable `age` and assign a value.
  2. Write a program that checks if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount (age >= 60).
  3. Use an `if-else` statement to print "Eligible for discount" or "Not eligible for discount."
