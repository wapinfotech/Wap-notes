### Task: Fetch User Data from API

#### **Objective**:
Fetch user data from the API endpoint: [https://dummyjson.com/users/1](https://dummyjson.com/users/1) and log the user's name and email to the console. This task will help you practice using both `.then()` and `async/await` methods to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Using `.then()` Method**:
   - Make a `fetch()` request to the API.
   - Convert the response to JSON.
   - Log the user's `data` to the console.
   - Handle any errors using `.catch()`.

2. **Using `async/await` Method**:
   - Create an `async` function to make the same `fetch()` request.
   - Use `await` to wait for the response and convert it to JSON.
   - Log the user's `data` to the console.
   - Use a `try/catch` block to handle any errors.
